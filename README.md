# About Me 

My name is Luis Daniel Cruz, and I am a second-year Master of Urban and Regional Planning Candidate at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. My concentrations are Community and Regional Economic Development. Before transitioning into the field of planning, I worked as a public school teacher here in Los Angeles. 


# Project Idea
For this course, I want to look into the demographic changes within low-income regions/neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and contrast them with educational attainment or success trends within its local public LAUSD schools. I'd like to see if there is some association present when visualizing data in the scope of types of housing + socioeconomic levels and students' academic success in the immediately located schools. How has that changed in the last couple of years (visualizing how gentrification affects public school performance type of thing)? 


# Course Objectives
Through the scope of this course, I hope to become more comfortable engaging with data and presenting it in an efficiently visual manner if possible. I want to develop best practice skills when working with GIS software and develop a more solid understanding of spatial data as it relates to social issues.
